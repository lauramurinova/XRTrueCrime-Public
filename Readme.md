# XR True Crime

<div style="text-align: start; justify-content: center;">

**Summary:**  
Thanks to XR True Crime, anyone can now be a detective for a day! You can listen to interrogations, go through suspects, find clues - even hidden ones, use your belt to store your tools, and tag the evidence. Mark all the clues found in the interactive tablet and select hypotheses to prove your crime.

**Skills Utilized:**
- Unity
- Meta SDK (Anchors, Passthrough, Interaction, Swipe Gestures, Body Movement)
- Customized models in Blender

**Potential Improvements:**
- Enhance the app by incorporating scene interrogations, not just audio.
- Add multiple murder cases, more objectives, and additional clues.
